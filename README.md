How To Open Your Project Tomorrow
✅ Step 1 — Start MongoDB (if not auto-started)

Usually MongoDB starts automatically.

But to be safe, open Command Prompt (Admin) and run:

net start MongoDB

If it says:

The requested service has already been started.

✅ Good. Move to next step.

✅ Step 2 — Go To Your Project Folder
cd C:\Users\Raji_kabilan\OneDrive\Desktop\agrisense_app
✅ Step 3 — Activate Virtual Environment
venv\Scripts\activate

You must see:

(venv) C:\Users\Raji_kabilan\OneDrive\Desktop\agrisense_app>

⚠ If you don’t see (venv) → stop and fix that first.

✅ Step 4 — Run Flask App
python app.py

You should see:

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
✅ Step 5 — Open Browser

Go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

Your AgriSense app will open 🌾🚀
